## ðŸ§  Escrow Logic to Implement

### 1. When `deliveryStatus` becomes `"Delivered"`

```ts
subOrder.returnWindow = now + 7 days;
```

- Set the return window countdown.
- Should be triggered when delivery is marked as "Delivered".

---

### 2. In a daily cron job (or background worker)

```ts
if (
  !subOrder.escrow.released &&
  Date.now() > subOrder.returnWindow &&
  subOrder.deliveryStatus === "Delivered"
) {
  releaseFundsToSellerWallet(subOrder);
  subOrder.escrow.released = true;
  subOrder.escrow.held = false;
  subOrder.escrow.releasedAt = new Date();
}
```

- Release funds only if:
  - Not already released
  - Delivery is complete
  - Return window has expired

---

### 3. If the sub-order is `"Returned"` and return is approved

```ts
refundBuyer(subOrder);
subOrder.escrow.held = false;
subOrder.escrow.released = false;
subOrder.escrow.refunded = true;
```

- Buyer is refunded.
- Escrow is closed (no funds held or released to seller).

---

### 4. Use PascalCase for Mongoose model and schema names

-- why the is no status attached to the url thereby, making the succes page to malfunction
+### 5. Checkout success redirect: verify serverâ€‘side and render status

- +Example (placeholder): +https://example.com/checkout/success?reference={tx_ref}
- +- Do not expose live/internal URLs or real transaction IDs in docs.
  +- Donâ€™t rely on a `status` query param. On page load, read `reference` and call the backend:
- 1.  Backend verifies with the PSP using `reference`.
- 2.  Return canonical status (success | pending | failed) and amounts.
- 3.  Render the appropriate UI; handle pending gracefully.
      +- Implement idempotent verification and a webhook listener to reconcile delayed notifications.
