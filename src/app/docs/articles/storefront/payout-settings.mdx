## Understanding Payout Accounts

Payout accounts are the bank accounts where Soraxi transfers your earnings. Key features:

- **Secure bank verification** with real-time account validation
- **Multiple account support** (you can add several bank accounts)
- **Automatic payouts** based on your store's payout schedule

- **Current payout accounts** displayed as cards
- **Bank name and account number** (partially masked for security)

  validates it without exposing it to human operators.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Account Verification

**Automatic Validation**:

- System automatically verifies your account number against the selected bank
- Account holder name is fetched and displayed automatically
- Verification typically takes 2-5 seconds

**If verification fails**:

**Final Checks**:

<Note type="success">
  The account name must exactly match your bank records. If it doesn't, the
  payout transfers will fail.
