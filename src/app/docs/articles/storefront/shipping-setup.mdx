  You can create up to 1 shipping method initially. Additional methods may be
  available as your store grows.

## Shipping Best Practices

### Pricing Strategy

**Competitive Pricing Tips**:

- Research similar stores' shipping costs
- Consider offering free shipping above a certain order value
- Factor in your packaging materials cost
- Remember Soraxi commission when calculating profitability

### Delivery Timeframes

**Realistic Time Estimates**:

- **Processing time**: 1-2 business days to prepare orders
- **Transit time**: 2-5 business days depending on location
- **Total estimate**: Add processing + transit time

<Tip>
  Under-promise and over-deliver. If you can deliver in 3 days, set the
  expectation at 4-5 days to account for unexpected delays.
</Tip>

### Customer Communication

**Clear Descriptions Should Include**:

- Exact delivery process
- Order cutoff times for same-day processing
- What happens if delivery attempts fail
- Contact information for shipping inquiries
